# WasteManagement

## Idea 1

The idea is to connect waste containers in a city with IoT devices which will provide information about several parameters such as volume occupied, fulfillment height, mass, temperature. The IoT devices will send the data to a backend server hub and will calculate a smart/effective route for picking up the waste with trucks, having in mind what kind of container is full **(glass, paper, metal, e-waste, organic, etc)**, the appropriate truck is arranged for the activity. 

## Idea 2

**There is another** use case which takes into consideration that when a user throws garbage into the container he will use RFID tag which will be ticked by the container (the same way as loyalty cards work) and will collect points for that activity, and later those points can be monetized or swapped for parking minutes or some other award.
